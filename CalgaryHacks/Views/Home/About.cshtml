                household income has increased 19.7% in the past five years to a median of around $99.6K.
                Although recent downturn had caused office vacancy to increase, this created many opportunities
                for many businesses outside of Calgary to acquire at competitive prices. Calgary's greatest asset however,
                is its world-class workforce with a hub of talent surrounding our advanced Science, Technology, Engineering,
                and Math (STEM) skills that attract many companies to the city.
